Description: Calculates estimates of phenological metrics from incidental observaton data.
             It can be used to estimtate a parameterized phenological metric and CIs 
             from observation data for any percentile of a distribution. The package can 
             also be used to estimate naive percentile (quantile) estimates and CIs using
